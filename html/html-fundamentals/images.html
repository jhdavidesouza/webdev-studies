                        src="" (where does this image come from?)
                        src="URL"
                        src="../../directory/yourImage.png"

                        alt="" (alternative text for when the image doesn't load)
                        alt="this is an image of a firefly" (and in the src tag there is a link directing to an image of a firefly)
