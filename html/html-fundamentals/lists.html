                    Besides CD-quality streams, as part of Tidal's £20 per month HiFi package, 
                    you can access millions of hi-res audio tracks, which are typically 24-bit/96kHz 
                    but do go up to 24-bit/192kHz. Called 'Tidal Masters', the music files are encoded 
                    using MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) tech, which allows for more efficient packing 
                    of the hi-res data.

                    Spotify remains comfortably the most popular and accessible way 
                    to get your music fix. Not only does it offer decent 320Kbps quality, 
                    but there is a huge library of over 40 million songs. These can be played 
                    on pretty much any device you own, thanks to intuitive iOS and Android apps 
                    and support in numerous smart TVs, connected speakers and other AV kit courtesy 
                    of Spotify Connect.

                    Unsurprisingly, Apple Music is aimed squarely at Apple users, so Android owners often want to look elsewhere – although that's slowly changing. However, if you're fully immersed in Apple's ecosystem, Apple Music makes a lot of sense. It costs a competitive £10 per month, or you can pay an annual fee of £99. There's also a £5 per month student deal, while a family membership covering up to six people costs £15 per month.
